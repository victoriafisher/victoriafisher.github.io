   <p>THE PESTO MANIFESTO / 2008
       Peter Nowogrodzki</p>

<p>This is the pesto manifesto; an improvised recipe of sorts. 
    When making pesto, here are some things to keep in mind:</p>

<p>1.	Must use organic garlic if you live in the 21st Ce.
2.	Must use fresh basil from your mom or neighbours garden.
3.	Must use pine nuts.
4.	No food processing allowed.</p>
       
<p>These are important because pesto is a delicacy that deserves to be made right.
    Pasta should not be smothered in mediocrity! <br>Or should it?</p>
