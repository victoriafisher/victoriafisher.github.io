<h1>THE PESTO MANIFESTO /<strong> 2008 </strong></h1>
      <h2>Peter Nowogrodzki</h2>

      <p>This is the <em>pesto manifesto;</em> an improvised recipe of sorts. When making pesto, here are some things to keep in mind:</p>
<ol>
<li>Must use organic garlic if you live in the 21st Ce.</li>
<li>Must use fresh basil from your mom or neighbourâ€™s garden.</li>
<li>Must use pine nuts.</li>
<li>No food processing allowed.</li>
      </ol>
<p>These are important because pesto is a delicacy that deserves to be made right.
    Pasta should not be smothered in mediocrity! <strong> Or should it? </strong></p>
