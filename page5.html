      <h3>These are important because pesto is a delicacy that deserves to be made right.</h3>
<h2>Pasta should not be smothered in mediocrity! Or should it?</h2>
<ul>
Become inspired by mediocre productions.
Don’t covert production and experimentation recipe.
Always leave the edges rough, so that someone can cut themselves.
A photoshop’d joke is deep and meaningful.
Take the knife to cultural icons and produce: produce the produce for the recipe and destroy the recipe.
Follow and muddy up every else’s recipe; pun and play, annihilate and resurrect meaning.</ul>
<p><strong>Keep in mind: pesto is delicious when it’s made fresh.</strong></p>
