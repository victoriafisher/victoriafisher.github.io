<p>These are important because pesto is a delicacy that deserves to be made right.<br>
Pasta should not be smothered in mediocrity! <br>Or should it?
</p>

      <p>1.	Become inspired by mediocre productions.</p>
<p>2.	Don’t covert production and experimentation recipe.</p>
      <p>3.	Always leave the edges rough, so that someone can cut themselves.</p>
      <p>4.	A photoshop’d joke is deep and meaningful.</p>
      <p>5.	Take the knife to cultural icons and produce: produce the produce for the recipe and destroy the recipe.</p>
      <p>6.	Follow and muddy up every else’s recipe; pun and play, annihilate and resurrect meaning.</p>
      <p>Keep in mind: pesto is delicious when it’s made fresh.</p>
